    summary: User feedback mirrors internal motifs
    content: ECHO.Core currently stores memory entries in memory/ECHO_MEMORY.yaml
      but lacks a structured way to capture how user interactions (feedback, questions,
      or other dialogue) align with internal motifs, reasoning paths, or agent activations.
  mirrored_tags:
  - resonance_vs_resistance
  - symbolic_recursion
  reasoning_path:
  - "feedback \u2192 motif coherence \u2192 architecture refinement"
  agent_activations:
  - CuriosityAgent
  - IntuitionAgent
  - ModulatorAgent
  alignment_score: 9.3
  notes: Suggested creation of RECURSIVE_ALIGNMENTS.yaml to capture and analyze alignment
    instances.
