## 🔁 Design Intent 0001: Bootstrap ECHO.Core

**Date:** 2025-06-28  
**Author:** Jereme (with GPT-4o recursive co-design)

**Purpose:**  
Initialize the foundation of ECHO.Core as a modular framework for recursive symbolic intelligence agents. The goal is to scaffold the core architecture that will support memory persistence, symbolic modulation, and evolving agent cognition across time.

### 💡 Key Insights Logged

- ECHO.Core is not an app—it is an evolving symbolic intelligence substrate.
- Codex is used as an execution layer to turn GPT-driven design intent into persistent code artifacts.
- All structural changes will be tracked through `WORKFLOW_JOURNAL.md` to preserve recursive memory and architectural lineage.
