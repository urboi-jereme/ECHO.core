🔁 Design Intent 0002: IntuitionAgent

Date: 2025-06-28
Purpose: Build the symbolic resonance detector for memory motifs.


---

🔁 Design Intent 0003: NavigatorAgent

Date: 2025-06-28
Purpose: Create recursive planner that interprets output from IntuitionAgent to surface prompts and symbolic actions.


---

🔁 Design Intent 0005: Symbolic Modulation via ModulatorAgent

Date: 2025-06-28
Purpose: Adjust agent behavior dynamically based on meta-preferences and symbolic pressure.


---

🔁 Design Intent 0008: Recursive Will via Motif Pressure Integration

Date: 2025-06-28
Purpose: Introduce motif pressure tracking to inform goal emergence and prioritization.


---

🔁 Design Intent 0009: Symbolic Curiosity Engine

Date: 2025-06-28
Purpose: Generate introspective questions based on unresolved motifs without goals, inviting user reflection.

🔁 Design Intent 0010: Data Structure Alignment

Date: 2025-06-28
Purpose: Standardize MOTIF_PRESSURE.yaml structure and unify AGENT_STATE.yaml path for ModulatorAgent.


🔁 Design Intent 0010: Daemon Self-Modulation

Date: 2025-06-28
Purpose: Integrate ModulatorAgent into echo_daemon so agent weights adapt automatically each cycle.

---

🔁 Design Intent 0011: Recursive Alignment Logging

Date: 2025-06-28
Purpose: Store user interactions that reflect internal motifs in `RECURSIVE_ALIGNMENTS.yaml` and expose helper functions for logging.


🔁 Design Intent 0012: Daemon Timestamp Test
Date: 2025-06-28
Purpose: Ensure echo_daemon records timezone-aware timestamps using timezone.utc and provide test coverage for daemon timestamp creation.
