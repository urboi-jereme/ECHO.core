🔁 Design Intent 0010: Data Structure Alignment

Date: 2025-06-28
Purpose: Standardize MOTIF_PRESSURE.yaml structure and unify AGENT_STATE.yaml path for ModulatorAgent.


🔁 Design Intent 0010: Daemon Self-Modulation

Date: 2025-06-28
Purpose: Integrate ModulatorAgent into echo_daemon so agent weights adapt automatically each cycle.

---

🔁 Design Intent 0011: Recursive Alignment Logging

Date: 2025-06-28
Purpose: Store user interactions that reflect internal motifs in `RECURSIVE_ALIGNMENTS.yaml` and expose helper functions for logging.

🔁 Design Intent 0012: Notebook Utilities Module
Date: 2025-06-28
Purpose: Centralize notebook setup and YAML helpers in `notebooks/setup.py` and simplify notebook code.
---

🔁 Design Intent 0012: Sync Agent Weight Refactor

Date: 2025-06-28
Purpose: Persist agent weights in AGENT_STATE.yaml using top-level mappings and update runtime sync accordingly.

🔁 Design Intent 0012: Daemon Timestamp Test
Date: 2025-06-28
Purpose: Ensure echo_daemon records timezone-aware timestamps using timezone.utc and provide test coverage for daemon timestamp creation.

---

🔁 Design Intent 0012: Diagnostic Root Option

Date: 2025-06-28
Purpose: Allow `run_diagnostics` to accept an optional project root so notebooks can specify paths explicitly.

🔁 Design Intent 0012: Curiosity Response Logging
