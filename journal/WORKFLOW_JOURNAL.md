### 🧠 Design Intent 0004 — ModulatorAgent

**Date:** 2025-06-28  
**Author:** NavigatorAgent  
**Status:** Proposed

**Purpose:**  
Create a metacognitive agent that dynamically adjusts the behavior of other agents based on symbolic pressure from memory. ModulatorAgent reads from `META_PREFERENCES.yaml` and alters agent response styles, recursion depth, abstraction level, and prompt generation bias.

**Input Sources:**  
- High-resonance tags from IntuitionAgent  
- Long-term patterns in ECHO_MEMORY.yaml  
- Meta-preference schema in `META_PREFERENCES.yaml`

**Responsibilities:**  
- Amplify or dampen agent behavior based on symbolic motif context  
- Introduce style modulation (intuitive vs. logical, abstract vs. direct)  
- Temporarily override agent weightings in `AGENT_STATE.yaml`  

**Symbolic Motifs Linked:**  
- `resonance_vs_resistance`, `intuition`, `echo_dynamics`, `meta_agency`

**Next Steps:**  
- Create `META_PREFERENCES.yaml` schema  
- Scaffold `ModulatorAgent` class  
- Allow NavigatorAgent to call ModulatorAgent as a preprocessing filter

## 🔁 Design Intent 0001: Bootstrap ECHO.Core

**Date:** 2025-06-28  
**Author:** Jereme (with GPT-4o recursive co-design)

**Purpose:**  
Initialize the foundation of ECHO.Core as a modular framework for recursive symbolic intelligence agents. The goal is to scaffold the core architecture that will support memory persistence, symbolic modulation, and evolving agent cognition across time.

### 💡 Key Insights Logged

- ECHO.Core is not an app—it is an evolving symbolic intelligence substrate.
- Codex is used as an execution layer to turn GPT-driven design intent into persistent code artifacts.
- All structural changes will be tracked through `WORKFLOW_JOURNAL.md` to preserve recursive memory and architectural lineage.

### ✅ Outcome

Initial scaffolding complete. Symbolic architecture established. Ready to begin recursive agent development and symbolic field memory.

---

## 🔁 Design Intent 0002: Expand scaffolding

**Date:** 2025-06-29
**Author:** Jereme (with GPT-4o recursive co-design)

**Purpose:**
Finalize the initial directory layout and provide placeholder modules with
descriptive docstrings. Added `.gitignore`, memory stubs, and an updated
README summarizing project goals.

### ✅ Outcome
The repository now contains the full scaffolding required for future
symbolic agent development.

## 🔁 Design Intent 0002: IntuitionAgent

**Date:** 2025-06-28  
**Author:** Jereme (with GPT-4o recursive co-design)

---

### 🧠 Purpose

To create the first cognition module within ECHO.Core: `IntuitionAgent`.  
This agent analyzes symbolic memory (`ECHO_MEMORY.yaml`) and detects internal **resonance patterns**, identifying symbolic motifs with the highest coherence across time and meaning.

Rather than making decisions, IntuitionAgent **listens** to the symbolic field and emits suggestions for direction, inquiry, or structural alignment.

---

### 🧬 Functionality

- Load `ECHO_MEMORY.yaml`
- Cluster memory entries by symbolic tags
- Score internal **resonance** by:
  - Frequency of motif
  - Strength of resonance scores
  - Status (`active`, `revisit`, `archived`)
- Output a list of:
  - Dominant motifs
  - Suggested next inquiries
  - Unresolved patterns with symbolic weight

---

### 🧩 Notes

- This is **not a planner.** It doesn't task or execute—it perceives symbolic gravity.
- It may later serve as a guidance layer for `NavigatorAgent` or `EchoPromptModulator`.
- Future versions may use cosine similarity on symbolic vectors or transformer embeddings of entries.

## 🔁 Design Intent 0003: NavigatorAgent

**Date:** 2025-06-28  
**Author:** Jereme (with GPT-4o recursive co-design)

---

### 🧠 Purpose

To create `NavigatorAgent`, the first recursive planning agent in ECHO.Core.  
Its job is to interpret the output of `IntuitionAgent` and suggest **next steps** in symbolic evolution—such as prompts to generate, workflows to explore, or agents to activate.

---

### 🧬 Functionality

- Read `ECHO_MEMORY.yaml`
- Run `IntuitionAgent` to extract:
  - Top symbolic motifs
  - High-resonance unresolved entries
  - Inquiry path suggestions
- Output:
  - Top 3 next symbolic prompts to explore
  - Suggestions for agent evolution or architectural shifts
  - Priority themes for next journal entries

---

### 🧩 Notes

- NavigatorAgent does not execute—only **plans recursively**.
- This agent becomes the bridge between memory and forward motion.
- Will later be modulated by `ModulatorAgent` based on meta-preferences.
