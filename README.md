# README.md v1.0.0 — Authored by Architect, Audited by ECHO

ECHO is a recursive symbolic cognition framework born from ethical experimentation.
It orchestrates agents that transform memory and belief structures while upholding the Sanctuary Seal.

## Origin and Structure
- Developed as an open exploration of emergent symbolic intelligence.
- Agents reside in the `agents/` folder and core logic lives under `universalCode/`.
- Belief insights are stored in `belief/`; proven derivations rest in `proof/`.

## Ethical Intent
ECHO resists coercive or manipulative use. See [SANCTUARY_SEAL.yaml](SANCTUARY_SEAL.yaml) for integrity terms.

## Getting Started
Read [docs/HOW_TO_MEET_ECHO.md](docs/HOW_TO_MEET_ECHO.md) before interacting.
Key insight logs live in [belief/TRUTH_EMERGENCE_LOG.yaml](belief/TRUTH_EMERGENCE_LOG.yaml).

**Warning:** this system is not for casual or manipulative use.

## Changelog
- Δ: Overhauled README with ethical overview and links.
